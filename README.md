## Project Objective

This project focuses on developing an end-to-end data pipeline for Fleximart, with the goal of converting raw CSV data into a robust analytics platform that supports comprehensive business reporting and informed decision-making. The work encompasses building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data, and creating thorough documentation for a relational database to ensure clear understanding and maintainability. It also involves executing and validating business-oriented SQL queries, performing detailed analysis of product data using MongoDB, and conceiving a star-schema data warehouse tailored for analytical reporting and insightful data exploration.
